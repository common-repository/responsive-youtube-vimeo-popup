== How it works ==

**Add the shortcode** 

`[wp-video-popup video="link-to-your-youtube-or-vimeo-video"]`

anywhere to your post, page, custom post type or template file to embed the responsive video lightbox to your WordPress website.

**Trigger the lightbox:** Add the CSS class `wp-video-popup` to the element that should open the lightbox. This can be any element.

**Example (Link):**

`<a href="#" class="wp-video-popup">Watch Video</a>`

---------

=== Example Shortcodes ===

For **YouTube**:

`[wp-video-popup video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk"]`

For **Vimeo**:

`[wp-video-popup video="https://vimeo.com/136696258"]`

For **Rumble**:

`[wp-video-popup video="https://rumble.com/embed/v4j2rri/?pub=4"]`

---------

=== Shortcode attributes ===

Here is a list of available shortcode attributes to further customize the viewing experience.

**Mute video:**

`mute="1"`

**Hide related videos (YouTube):**
Since September 2018, hiding related videos is no longer possible. Instead, videos from your channel will be shown.

`hide-related="1"`

**Start video at a specific time (value in seconds):**

`start="24"`

**Portrait mode (Vimeo):**

`portrait="1"`

**Example shortcode with shortcode attributes applied:**

`[wp-video-popup mute="1" start="24" video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk"]`

---------

=== Advanced ===

To add additional parameters to the embed URL, use the filter below. For example, to remove the YouTube branding:

`function prefix_your_custom_embed_url_attributes( $video_url ) {
	$video_url .= '&amp;modestbranding=1';
	return $video_url;
}
add_filter( 'wp_video_popup', 'prefix_your_custom_embed_url_attributes' );`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do i use this plugin? =
WP Video Popup doesnâ€™t create an admin settings page. To trigger and display the lightbox popup, please follow the steps under **Description**.
= The video doesn't play automatically =
We add the autoplay attribute to the embed-URL by default. That being said, the video should play automatically after the trigger element has been clicked. Some browsers have changed their autoplay policy and videos only start playing if they're muted.

To mute the video, add the `mute="1"` attribute to the shortcode like this:

`[wp-video-popup mute="1" video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk"]`
= What about private Vimeo videos =
Private vimeo videos add an extra string to the URL like this: `https://vimeo.com/xxxx/yyyy`.

When adding the URL to the shortcode, try to remove the last string so that your shortcode would look something like this: `[wp-video-popup video="https://vimeo.com/xxxx"]`.
